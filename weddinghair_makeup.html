  <br>Bookings:
  Your appointment date(s) and service(s) will be secured when the signed contract and a NON-REFUNDABLE deposit of $100.00 or other is received. Deposit amount is determined by the artist, and is based on the total quote or package price. All bookings for Weddings are made on a first-come-first-served basis. No dates will be guaranteed without a signed contract and deposit. We recommend all deposits be paid on the day of the trial to guarantee your bookings. Remaining balance is due the day of the wedding after services begin. Prices are subject to change as styling needs change, services are added, or travel distance change. Prices do not include gratuity. We accept cash or Venmo transfer at this time.

Costs may include but are not limited to: airfare, hotels, transportation, and parking. If the booked event is more than an hour and a half from 95008 and requires Artist(s) to start services by and before 7AM, client must provide hotel accommodation.

  <br>
  <br>Payments:
  The final balance is due on the day of the event before or after each services are performed.  Acceptable forms of payment are: Cash or Venmo transfer. Checks and credit/debit cards are currently not accepted. Gratuity is welcomed.
